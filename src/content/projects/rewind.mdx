Rewind provides developers with deep insight into HTTP traffic through real-time capture and analysis, making debugging network issues faster and more intuitive.

## Overview

Rewind is a modern network debugging tool that bridges the gap between low-level packet capture and high-level developer experience. Unlike traditional tools like Wireshark, Rewind focuses specifically on HTTP traffic and presents it in a developer-friendly web interface.

## Key Features

### In-Browser Terminal
- **Direct Agent Control** - Interact with the C++ capture agent from the web UI
- **Real-Time Output** - See captured packets as they arrive
- **Command History** - Navigate through previous commands

### Traffic Analysis
- **Real-Time Metrics** - Traffic monitoring with 2-second polling intervals
- **Request/Response Pairing** - Automatically correlate requests with their responses
- **Timing Breakdown** - See DNS, TCP, TLS, and server timing

### Privacy & Security
- **PII Sanitization** - Automatically anonymize sensitive data during capture
- **Configurable Redaction** - Define patterns for data you want hidden
- **Local Processing** - All data stays on your machine

### Developer Tools
- **Request Replay** - One-click functionality for debugging APIs
- **Syntax Highlighting** - HTTP headers viewer with proper formatting
- **Smart Parsing** - Automatic extraction of query parameters, cookies, and form data
- **Export Options** - Export sessions as HAR, cURL, or JSON

### Alerting System
- **Custom Rules** - Define alerts based on status codes, response times, and URL patterns
- **Email Notifications** - SMTP-based alerts with HTML templates
- **Webhook Support** - Integrate with Slack, Discord, or custom endpoints

### Session Management
- **MongoDB Storage** - Persistent session storage for later analysis
- **Filtering & Search** - Find specific requests across sessions
- **Tagging** - Organize sessions with custom tags

## Architecture

Rewind follows a three-tier architecture designed for performance and extensibility:

`} />

### C++ Capture Agent
- Built with **PcapPlusPlus** for high-performance packet capture
- Runs with elevated privileges for network interface access
- Communicates with backend via Unix sockets

### Bun/Elysia Backend
- **WebSocket Streams** - Real-time data push to frontend
- **Process Management** - Spawns and monitors capture agent
- **REST API** - Session CRUD operations and configuration

### SvelteKit Frontend
- **Reactive UI** - Updates instantly as packets arrive
- **TailwindCSS** - Clean, responsive design
- **Client-Side Storage** - Quick access to recent sessions

## Use Cases

- **API Debugging** - See exactly what your app sends and receives
- **Performance Analysis** - Identify slow endpoints and bottlenecks
- **Security Auditing** - Monitor for sensitive data leakage
- **Integration Testing** - Verify third-party API interactions
- **Learning Tool** - Understand HTTP protocol in depth

## Requirements

- Administrator/sudo access for network interface access
- Bun 1.0+ or Node.js 18+
- MongoDB instance for persistent storage
- Optional: SMTP server for email alerts

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sreekarnv/rewind.git
cd rewind

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Build the C++ agent
cd agent && cmake . && make

# Start the application
bun run dev
```

## What I Learned

Building Rewind pushed me to work across the entire stack:

- **C++ for performance** - When milliseconds matter, managed languages add overhead
- **WebSocket architecture** - Real-time data requires different thinking than REST
- **Cross-platform challenges** - Network APIs differ significantly between OSes
- **User experience** - Making complex data accessible requires careful design
